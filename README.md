# LIBRA_dashboard

A simple dashboard to visualize outputs from LIBRA (Lithium-Ion Battery Resource Assessment Model, https://www.nrel.gov/transportation/libra.html) simulations, made using ipywidgets and matplotlib. To use, run the Binder notebook, run all cells and scroll to the bottom to see the dashboard.

Currently, the dashboard requires the user to upload a CSV file containing outputs from LIBRA simulations in the vertical layout.
